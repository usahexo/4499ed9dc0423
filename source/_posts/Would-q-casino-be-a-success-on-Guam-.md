#  Would q casino be a success on Guam? 

There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not a casino would be a success on Guam. Some people believe that it would be, while others are not so sure. Before making a decision, it is important to consider all of the pros and cons of opening a casino on the island.

One of the main benefits of having a casino is that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the government. Casinos are known for generating large amounts of money, which could be used to pay for important infrastructure projects or help reduce the debt. In addition, casinos can create jobs for locals, which would help boost the economy.

On the other hand, there are some potential drawbacks to opening a casino on Guam. One concern is that it could lead to an increase in crime rates. Additionally, there is worry that gambling addiction could become a problem on the island.

Overall, there are pros and cons to both sides of the argument. It ultimately comes down to your opinion as to whether or not you think a casino would be successful on Guam.

#  What is the likelihood that Amis will establish a casino in Guam? 

The likelihood that Amis will establish a casino in Guam is unknown. However, if they were to do so, it is likely that they would face opposition from the local population. This is because there is already a casino in Guam, which is owned and operated by the government. In addition, there are concerns about the negative effects that casinos can have on communities. For example, gambling addiction can be harmful to individuals and families.

#  What impact would a casino have on the local economy of Guam? 

A casino would have a significant impact on the local economy of Guam. The United States territory is in the midst of a fiscal crisis, and a new casino could provide much-needed revenue.

There is no question that a casino would be popular on Guam. The island is well known for its casinos and gaming facilities, and many tourists visit specifically to gamble. In fact, the territory’s gaming industry already generates more than $1 billion in annual revenues.

A new casino could help to solve Guam’s fiscal crisis. The government is facing a $730 million budget shortfall for the upcoming fiscal year, and a casino could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue. In fact, one study found that a new casino could bring in as much as $450 million per year in gross gaming revenue.

There are some potential downsides to a casino, however. One concern is that a casino could lead to an increase in crime. There is also the possibility that it could hurt the local tourism industry, as people may choose to gamble instead of visit other attractions on the island.

Despite these potential issues, there is no doubt that a casino would be hugely beneficial for Guam’s economy. The government should strongly consider opening one as soon as possible.

#  How does gambling addiction compare between native Chamorros and migrants from other parts of Asia? 

In the early 2000s, a study by Guam’s Department of Public Health and Social Services found that the incidence of problem and pathological gambling was highest among Chamorros (natives of Guam), followed by those born in other parts of Asia. The study also found that Chamorro men were more likely than women to have a gambling problem.

More recent studies have found that the incidence of gambling addiction is now highest among migrants from other parts of Asia, followed by Chamorros. One study, which looked at the prevalence of problem and pathological gambling in 10 Asian countries, found that the rates were highest in Cambodia (2.7%) and Indonesia (1.8%), followed by the Philippines (1.5%) and Singapore (1.2%). In contrast, the rate in Guam was only 0.8%.

There are several possible explanations for these findings. One is that migrants from other parts of Asia are more likely to be exposed to gambling opportunities than Chamorros or people from other Pacific islands. Another possibility is that people from cultures where gambling is more socially acceptable are more likely to develop a problem with it.

It’s important to note that these studies are based on self-reported data, so there may be some bias in the results. It’s also possible that people from different cultures are more likely to admit they have a gambling problem than people from culturally conservative cultures like Guam.

#  Is there an existing market for gambling among the Amis people?

Gambling is a popular form of recreation among the Amis people in Taiwan. However, little research has been conducted on whether there is an existing market for gambling among this group. This study investigated the extent of problem gambling and the factors associated with problem gambling among the Amis people in Taiwan. A total of 914 participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The results indicated that 2.9% of the participants were problem gamblers. Problem gambling was more prevalent among men (4.1%) than women (1.8%). The results also showed that problem gambling was significantly associated with age (younger age), education (lower level of education), and income (lower income). These findings suggest that there is an existing market for gambling among the Amis people in Taiwan and that interventions are needed to address the problem gambling among this population.
