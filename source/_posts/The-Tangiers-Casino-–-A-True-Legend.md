#  How The Tangiers Casino Was Born

The Tangiers Casino was born in the early 1970s, and it was one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas. It was owned by Allen Glick, and it was located on the strip.

However, things didn't always go well for the casino. In fact, it had a very checkered past. For starters, it was allegedly owned by some of the biggest names in organized crime. This included people like Meyer Lansky and Carlos Marcello.

In addition, the casino was known for its links to illegal activities. For example, it's believed that the casino was used to launder money for the mob. It's also said that the casino was involved in loan sharking and other illicit activities.

Due to its ties to organized crime, the Tangiers Casino was constantly being investigated by law enforcement agencies. However, Glick always managed to keep them at bay. He was a shrewd businessman and he knew how to protect his interests.

The Tangiers Casino remained open until 1995, when it finally went out of business. This was due to numerous financial problems and a change in gambling legislation.

However, the casino ultimately fell on hard times and closed its doors for good in 1995. Here's a look at the rise and fall of The Tangiers Casino.

The Tangiers Casino was founded by Jerry Palmer in 1970. Palmer was a well-known figure in the casino industry, and he had previously been involved with the Moulin Rouge Casino in Las Vegas. The Tangiers was initially very successful, and it soon became one of the most popular casinos in town.

The Tangiers featured a number of high-profile celebrities as investors and owners, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and mob boss Sam Giancana. This gave the casino some added notoriety, and it helped to make it one of the most popular destinations in Las Vegas.

The Tangiers reached the height of its success in the 1980s. Revenue exceeded $1 billion during this time, and it became known as one of the "megacasinos" of Las Vegas. However, by the 1990s, things were starting to go downhill for the casino.

Tensions between Palmer and his celebrity investors began to grow, and several disputes arose over control of the casino. In 1995, Palmer finally sold The Tangiers to Mirage Resorts for $130 million. However, Mirage quickly closed down the casino due to its poor financial performance.

#  The Tangiers Casino – A History

The Tangiers Casino was one of the most infamous and well-known casinos in Las Vegas. It was opened in 1988 by Allen Glick and owned by the Argent Corporation. However, it was later sold to Mark Estes in 1992. The casino saw a lot of drama and controversy during its time, which led to it gaining a bad reputation.

One of the main controversies associated with the casino was its ties to the mob. It was thought that the casino was being used as a money laundering front for the mob, and this resulted in a lot of scrutiny from the press and authorities. In fact, there were multiple investigations into the casino’s activities, which only served to add to its notoriety.

Another issue that plagued the casino was its financial instability. This was largely due to its links to the mob, as crime bosses are not always known for being reliable sources of income. As a result, the casino went through several ownership changes and filed for bankruptcy in 1991.

Despite all of this, the Tangiers Casino managed to remain open until 2007. This was largely due to its strong reputation among gamblers – many were drawn to its dark and sordid atmosphere. In fact, it has been credited with helping to create the modern day image of Las Vegas.

Even after it closed down, the Tangiers Casino remains a popular topic of discussion among gambling enthusiasts. There have been numerous articles and books written about it, and it continues to be referenced in movies and TV shows. Overall, it is fair to say that the Tangiers Casino will be remembered as one of Las Vegas’ most notorious institutions.
