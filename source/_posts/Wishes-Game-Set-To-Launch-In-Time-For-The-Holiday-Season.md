#  Charity Gambling License In Hand, Wishes Game Ready To Roll

Wishes, a nonprofit casino game, has announced it is ready to open its doors to the public following the granting of its charity gambling license from the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner.

The new game will allow players to donate real money in exchange for in-game rewards such as bonuses and extra lives. These rewards can then be used to help players make their way up the game’s leaderboard and win cash prizes. The aim of the game is to raise money for charity, with 50% of all proceeds generated by Wishes going directly to good causes.

“We are excited to finally be able to offer our unique gaming experience to the public,” commented CEO and co-founder of Wishes, Edward Sonderling. “There are so many people who love playing casino games, but want to do something good with their money too. With Wishes, they can now enjoy themselves while helping others at the same time. We can’t wait to see how much we can raise for charity through our game.”

In order to ensure that all donations go directly to good causes, Wishes has partnered with several well-recognized charities including Children in Need and Cancer Research UK. Players will be able to select which of these charities they would like their donations to go towards when they create an account on the Wishes website.

In addition to raising money for charity, Wishes also aims to promote responsible gambling. All players must be over 18 years of age and each account is subject to a £10 daily limit on deposits in order to minimize any potential risks associated with excessive gambling behavior. Players who wish to deposit more than £10 per day can contact customer support in order gain increased limits if they can provide evidence that they are capable of managing their gaming responsibly.

Wishes is scheduled for release in early 2019 and will be available on both desktop and mobile devices.

“We’re excited to bring this innovative new game to Michigan residents, and to support the important work of the Make-A-Wish Foundation,” said Gamblify CEO Rakesh Gupta.

#  Wishes Board Game Mixes Fun With Fundraising

Wishes is a new board game that is not only fun to play, but also raises money for charity. Created by game designer Grant Rodiek, Wishes allows players to make choices that support one of four charities.

“I wanted to make a game that was both fun and philanthropic,” said Rodiek. “Players get to choose which charity they want to support, and every time they play they are raising money for that charity.”

Rodiek got the idea for Wishes while working on his previous game, SimCity: Skylines. He wanted to create a board game that could raise money for charity and came up with Wishes, a game where players travel through different lands collecting tokens that represent different wishes.

There are four different versions of the game, each supporting a different charity: wildlife conservation, children’s cancer research, animal rescue, and autism awareness. For each $24 purchase of a copy of the game, $10 goes to the chosen charity.

“I am really excited about this game because it is not only fun but it also supports charities that are important to me,” said Rodiek.

Wishes is currently available for pre-order on the Kickstarter website and is expected to ship in November 2018.
