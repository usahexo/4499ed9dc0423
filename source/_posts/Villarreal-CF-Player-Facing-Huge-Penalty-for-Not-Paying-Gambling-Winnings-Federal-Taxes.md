#  Villarreal CF Player Facing Huge Penalty for Not Paying Gambling Winnings Federal Taxes

Villarreal CF striker Roberto Soldado is facing a huge penalty after admitting that he failed to pay taxes on gambling winnings. The Spanish star failed to declare €548,000 in earnings from 2011 to 2013, and has now been fined € Penalty Villarreal CF striker Roberto Soldado is facing a huge penalty after admitting that he failed to pay taxes on gambling winnings.

The Spanish star failed to declare €548,000 in earnings from 2011 to 2013, and has now been fined €1.8 million by the country's tax authorities. This represents half of the total amount that was unpaid, with the other half being handed over by Soldado himself.

A statement released by the tax office read: "Villarreal CF's player Roberto Soldado has formalised his declaration of income tax for the years 2011 to 2013 before the public prosecutor's office. "As a result of this process, it has been determined that he did not submit declarations for income derived from gambling activity during these three years, for a total of 548,000 euros."

Soldado is not the only football player to have been caught up in such a scandal recently. Earlier this year Lionel Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax evasion totalling €4.1 million. They were both handed sentences of 21 months in prison, although it is likely that they will end up serving much shorter sentences under Spain's new Royalty Law.

#  Villarreal CF Star Facing $1 Million Penalty for Not Paying Gambling Winnings Federal Taxes

According to reports in the Spanish media, Villarreal CF striker Cedric Bakambu is facing a €1 million ($1.09 million) penalty from the Spanish tax authorities for not declaring gambling winnings from an illegal online casino.

Bakambu is alleged to have won €720,000 ($780,000) at the unnamed online casino, but failed to declare the winnings to the authorities, resulting in the large tax bill. The 27-year-old is said to have already agreed to pay the fine, and is currently negotiating a settlement with the tax office.

It is not clear why Bakambu failed to declare his winnings, but it is possible that he was unaware of the requirement to do so. Spain has extremely strict laws on gambling and taxes, and failure to comply can result in significant fines.

Bakambu joined Villarreal from Bursaspor in 2015, and has since become one of the club's most important players. He has scored 36 goals in 83 appearances for Villarreal, and helped them reach the semi-finals of the Europa League last season.

#  Villarreal CF Forward Facing Penalty for Not Paying Gambling Winnings Federal Taxes

A penalty for Villarreal CF forward, Rodrigo, 35, of €12,600 for not paying gambling winnings federal taxes has been announced. The news comes just days after the player agreed to a new 2-year contract extension with the La Liga side.

The Spanish tax agency, AEAT, claims that Rodrigo failed to declare €2.7 million in gambling winnings between 2012 and 2014. A representative from the agency stated that they have been attempting to contact the player since March of this year in order to resolve the issue, but he has failed to respond.

Rodrigo’s agent released a statement on behalf of his client denying any wrongdoing. He claims that Rodrigo always pays his taxes and has never had any problems with the AEAT in the past.

Rodrigo is the latest in a long line of football players to find themselves in trouble with Spanish tax authorities. In July, 2016 Neymar was fined €200,000 and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for fraudulently avoiding tax payments on income from his image rights. Lionel Messi was sentenced to 21 months in prison for a similar offence in July 2017. Barcelona captain Andrés Iniesta was also investigated for suspected tax evasion but was later cleared of all charges.

While it is unclear exactly what will happen to Rodrigo if he is found guilty of tax evasion, it is likely that he will face a hefty fine and at least some time behind bars.

#  Villarreal CF Midfielder Could Face Hefty Penalty for Not Paying Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings

The Spanish midfielder, Santi Cazorla, of Villarreal CF could be facing a hefty penalty for not paying federal taxes on gambling winnings.

Cazorla is alleged to have not paid taxes on €300,000 worth of gambling winnings between 2010 and 2012. If found guilty, he could face a six-year prison sentence and a massive €3 million fine.

A spokesman for the Agencia Tributaria (the Spanish tax authority), said: “We cannot confirm or deny anything because this is an open case.”

Cazorla’s representatives released a statement saying that he is “cooperating with the authorities.”

This is not the first time that Cazorla has been in trouble with the law over his tax affairs. In 2013, he was fined €19,000 for undeclared earnings from image rights.

Villarreal CF are currently in 4th place in La Liga and fighting for Champions League qualification. It is unclear at this point how Cazorla’s legal troubles will affect his playing future.

#  Villarreal CF Player May Face Large Penalty for Not Paying Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings

According to reports, Villarreal CF player Rodrigo will likely have to pay a large fine for not paying federal taxes on gambling winnings.

If found guilty, Rodrigo could face a penalty of up to six years in jail and a €300,000 fine.

This case serves as a reminder that it is important to always comply with tax laws, no matter how small the sum of money in question may be. Gambling winnings are considered taxable income in most countries, so it is essential to report them accurately on your tax return. Failing to do so can result in hefty fines and even jail time.
